# Concurrent Data Structures

## Included Algorithms
### Persistent Non-Blocking Binary Search Tree (PNB-BST)
This is an implementation of PNB-BST algorithm described in the paper
"Persistent Non-Blocking Binary Search Trees Supporting Wait-Free Range Queries"
of Panagiota Fatourou, Elias Papavasileiou and Eric Ruppert.

### Batched Persistent Non-Blocking Binary Search Tree (BPNB-BST)
This is an optimized version of PNB-BST algorithm that supports key batching in the leafs.

## Acknowledgements
[Trevor Brown](https://bitbucket.org/trbot86/) provided the implementation of [Non-Blocking Binary Search Tree](https://bitbucket.org/trbot86/implementations/src/6dbe554bbea072bdd5ec344a2653d93cd502d5a8/java/src/algorithms/published/LockFreeBSTMap.java) (NB-BST) on which the implementation of PNB-BST was based on.
